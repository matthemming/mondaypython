I canâ€™t stress how important smoke alarms are, you should have one on every floor of your property and test them regularly.\\r\\n\"Thanks to the alarm, seven members of staff were able to leave the building in good time but had they not had an early warning there could have been a very different outcome.â€\\x9d\\r\\nFifteenÂ\\xa0fire engines andÂ\\xa0two aerial ladder platforms were at the scene from stations including East Greenwich, Plumstead, Erith, Lee Green, Eltham, Deptford and Bexley.\\r\\nThe Brigade was called at 0924 and the fire was under control at 1317.
